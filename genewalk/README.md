GeneWalk determines for individual genes the functions that are relevant in a
particular biological context and experimental condition. GeneWalk quantifies
the similarity between vector representations of a gene and annotated GO terms
through representation learning with random walks on a condition-specific gene
regulatory network. Similarity significance is determined through comparison
with node similarities from randomized networks.

## Install GeneWalk
To install the latest release of GeneWalk (preferred):
```
pip install genewalk
```
To install the latest code from Github (typically ahead of releases):
```
pip install git+https://github.com/churchmanlab/genewalk.git
```

## Using GeneWalk

### Gene list file
GeneWalk always requires as input a text file containing a list with genes of interest
relevant to the biological context. For example, differentially expressed genes
from a sequencing experiment that compares an experimental versus control condition.
GeneWalk supports gene list files containing HGNC human gene symbols,
HGNC IDs, human Ensembl gene IDs, or MGI mouse gene IDs. Each line in the file
contains a gene identifier of one of these types.

### GeneWalk command line interface
Once installed, GeneWalk can be run from the command line as `genewalk`, with
a set of required and optional arguments. The required arguments include the
project name, a path to a text file containing a list of genes, and an argument
specifying the types of genes in the file.

Example
```bash
genewalk --project context1 --genes gene_list.txt --id_type hgnc_symbol
```

Below is the full documentation of the command line interface:

```

                        The source of the network to be used.Possible values
                        are: pc, indra, edge_list, and sif. In case of indra,
                        edge_list, and sif, the network_file argument must be
                        specified. Default: pc
  --network_file NETWORK_FILE
                        If network_source is indra, this argument points to a

                        constituting the network is contained. In case
                        network_source is edge_list or sif, the network_file

  --save_dw SAVE_DW     If True, the full DeepWalk object for each repeat is
                        saved in the project folder. This can be useful for
                        debugging but the files are typically very large.

                        If provided, the random number generator is seeded
                        with the given value. This should only be used if the
                        goal is to deterministically reproduce a prior result
                        obtained with the same random seed.

```


### Output files
GeneWalk automatically creates a `genewalk` folder in the user's home folder
(or the user specified base_folder).
When running GeneWalk, one of the required inputs is a project name.
A sub-folder is created for the given project name where all intermediate and
final results are stored. The files stored in the project folder are:
- **`genewalk_results.csv`** - The main results table, a comma-separated values text file. See below for detailed description.
- `genes.pkl` - A processed representation of the given gene list, in Python pickle (.pkl) binary file format.
- `multi_graph.pkl` - A networkx MultiGraph resembling the GeneWalk network which was assembled based on the
given list of genes, an interaction network, GO annotations, and the GO ontology.
- `deepwalk_node_vectors_*.pkl` - A set of learned node vectors for each analysis repeat for the graph.
- `deepwalk_node_vectors_rand_*.pkl` - A set of learned node vectors for each analysis repeat for a random graph.
- `genewalk_rand_simdists.pkl` - Distributions constructed from repeats.
- `deepwalk_*.pkl` - A DeepWalk object for each analysis repeat on the graph
(only present if save_dw argument is set to True).
- `deepwalk_rand_*.pkl` - A DeepWalk object for each analysis repeat on a random graph
(only present if save_dw argument is set to True).


### GeneWalk results file description
`genewalk_results.csv` is the main GeneWalk output table, a comma-separated values text file
with the following column headers:
- hgnc_id - human gene HGNC identifier.
- **hgnc_symbol** - human gene symbol.
- **go_name** - GO term name.
- go_id - GO term identifier.
- go_domain - Ontology domain that GO term belongs to
(biological process, cellular component or molecular function).
- ncon_gene - number of connection to gene in GeneWalk network.
- ncon_go - number of connections to GO term in GeneWalk network.
- **mean_padj** - mean false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value of the similarity between gene and GO term.
This is the key statistic indicating how relevant the GO term (function) is to the gene in the
particular biological context or tested condition. GeneWalk determines an adjusted p-value with
Benjamini Hochberg FDR correction for multiple tested of all connected GO term for each
nreps_graph repeat analysis. The value presented here is the average over all p-adjust values
from each repeat analysis. 
- cilow_padj - lower bound of 95% confidence interval on mean_padj estimate from the nreps_graph repeat analyses.
- ciupp_padj - upper bound of 95% confidence interval on mean_padj estimate.
- mean_pval - mean p-values of gene - GO term similarities, not FDR corrected for multiple testing.
- cilow_pval - lower bound of 95% confidence interval on mean_pval estimate.
- ciupp_pval - upper bound of 95% confidence interval on mean_pval estimate.
- mean_sim - mean of gene - GO term similarities.
- sem_sim - standard error on mean_sim estimate.
- mgi_id - in case mouse gene MGI identifiers were provided as input, the GeneWalk results
table starts with an additional mgi_id column to indicate these mouse genes. In this
case the corresponding hgnc_id and hgnc_symbol resemble its human ortholog
gene used for the GeneWalk analysis.


### Stages and run times of GeneWalk algorithm
Given a list of genes, GeneWalk runs three stages of analysis:
1. Assembling a GeneWalk network and learning node vector representations
by running DeepWalk on this network, for a specified number of repeats.
Typical run time: one to a few hours.
2. Learning random node vector representations by running DeepWalk on a set of
randomized versions of the GeneWalk network, for a specified number of
repeats. Typical run time: one to a few hours.
3. Calculating statistics of similarities between genes and GO terms, and
outputting  the GeneWalk results in a table. Typical run time: a few minutes.

GeneWalk can either be run once to complete all these stages (default), or called separately
for each stage (optional argument: stage).
Recommended memory availability on your operating system: 16Gb or 32Gb RAM.
Recommended number of processors (optional argument: nproc) for a short run time is 4:
```bash
genewalk --project context1 --genes gene_list.txt --id_type hgnc_symbol --nproc 4
```
GeneWalk outputs the uncertainty (95% confidence intervals) of the similarity significance
(mean p-adjust). Depending on the context-specific network topology, this uncertainty can be
large for individual gene - function associations. However, if overall the uncertainties
turn out very large, one can set the optional arguments nreps_graph to 10 (or more) and
nreps_null to 10 to increase the algorithm's precision. This comes at the cost of an
increased run time.
